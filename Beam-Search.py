Question: Using the Beam search algorithm, find the shortest possible path for the person starting from New York City, 
visiting every city afterward only once and comes back home to New York City. Assume a beam value of 2. For your heuristics, 
use the total estimated distance which has been travelled thus far by the node.
I.e. if a node has travelled from New York -> Boston -> Chicago so far. 
Itâ€™s heuristic value would be 213 + 851 = 1064 Heuristic Value. 
Your output should show the result in the following format 
(Where City1 would be replaced by New York, City2 would be replaced by Los Angeles etc):
Path: City1 -> City2 -> City3 -> .... -> City1.

Total Estimated Distance: 2098 miles

Obversations
1.   List item
From the above the graph for beam values between 2 - 1000 the graph shows multiple local minima. generally the distance decreases as
beam value increases. on lower beam values the search space is typically narrow hence only limited number of path are explored.
this leads to local minimas. but as beam value approaches to 1000, the computation cost is increased however search space also increases
and this helps explore variety of paths escaping local minimas and providing optimal solution.
2.   List item

'''
   stochastic beam search vs local beam search
    
    stochastic beam search assigns a fitness score or certain function to each path. and then selects a particular path based 
    on its fitness score or particular function value which is considered the fittest. with this appraoch a certain randomness 
    is added to this selection process for a particular path. this helps in escaping the local minima solutions.
    
    example:
        in this particular problem of traveling salesman, while using local beam search if the start city is new york then 
        we can see in the Question 3 section that initially it takes path 0, 7, 2, 9, 10, 5, 4, 12, 11, 1, 8, 6, 3, 0 and 
        continues to consider going from 0 -> 7 -> 2 -> 9 -> 10 and does not consider any other possibility. this is the reason
        why we can see observe in the graph the local optima. stochastic beam search can provide more optimal solution and 
        avoid local optimas through random selection method based on which path is the fittest.
